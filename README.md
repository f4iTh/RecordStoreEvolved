# Record Store Evolved

This is a modification of the Monster Hunter Rise mod [Record Store](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/1725) for personal use.

## Differences

The key changes between this and the original mod are:

- Storing all records and keeping old records intact.
- Saving a timestamp of when a record was achieved for data analysis and graphing purposes.
- Creating a JSON schema for easy data validation.  

## TODO:

 - Create a similar mod for Monster Hunter World.
 - Update schema to match new data format.
 - Re-add ability to remove records.
	- Remove one record at a time or all records at once?
