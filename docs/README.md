This is a modification of the Monster Hunter Rise mod [Record Store](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/1725) created by [Kukuun on Nexus mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/95025793) for personal use.

## Differences

The key changes between this and the original mod are:

- Storing (new) records while keeping old records intact.
- Saving a timestamp of when a record was achieved for graphing purposes.
- Records are stored by save file (or more specifically by guild card unique id).

## TODO

 - Create/update schema to match new data format.
	- Or create a completely new format and schema?
 - Re-add ability to remove records.
	- Handle removing records through a basic ImGui menu?
- Store other details, such as weapons, armor, skills, etc. when a new record has been achieved?
- Store records in separate files?
